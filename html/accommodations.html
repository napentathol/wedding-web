                    <p>If you choose to fly into Indiana for the wedding the closest airport is&nbsp;Indianapolis International Airport, which is about one hour north of Bloomington. To get to&nbsp;Bloomington from the airport you can either rent a car OR take a shuttle. The hotels listed&nbsp;below are on a shuttle route. Flying in but don’t want to stay at either of the hotels listed&nbsp;below? Take the shuttle to the Indiana Memorial Union and grab an Uber or taxi from there.</p>
